Below, you'll find several open-source software packages I’ve developed. Each toolkit addresses different challenges in AI, graph-based analysis, and network representation. Feel free to explore their features, check out the GitHub repositories, and install them directly from PyPI.

# ROKSANA
![Roksana: Rewiring Of Keyword Search via Alteration of Network Architecture Toolkit](/images/softwares/roksana.png)

[![python-publish](https://github.com/radinhamidi/roksana/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/radinhamidi/roksana/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml)
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/roksana.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/roksana/)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/roksana.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/roksana/)
[![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/roksana.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/roksana/)


[Roksana](https://roksana.ls3.rnet.torontomu.ca) is a powerful Python library for graph-based keyword search using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It provides multiple search methods, including:

- **GCN-based Search**: Uses Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for graph-based retrieval.
- **GAT-based Search**: Leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to refine search rankings.
- **SAGE-based Search**: Implements GraphSAGE for scalable node embedding generation.

Additionally, Roksana supports **adversarial attacks** to analyze the robustness of search models, such as:
- **Degree-based attacks**: Removing high-degree nodes' edges to affect rankings.
- **PageRank attacks**: Selectively removing edges based on PageRank scores.
- **Custom attack strategies**: Users can define their own attack mechanisms.

### Installation

To install Roksana, use:

```sh
pip install roksana
```

Ready to get started? [Install PyDHNet from Roksana](https://pypi.org/project/ROKSANA/) or explore the source code and examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/radinhamidi/roksana).


# PyDHNet
![PyDHNet: A Python Library for Dynamic Heterogeneous Network Representation Learning and Evaluation](/images/softwares/pydhnet.png)


[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pydhnet.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pydhnet/)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/pydhnet.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pydhnet/)

### PyDHNet: Dynamic Heterogeneous Network Representation Learning

**PyDHNet** is an open-source Python library purpose-built for learning and evaluating representations in **dynamic heterogeneous networks**. While traditional tools often focus on static or homogeneous networks, PyDHNet fills a crucial gap by capturing the evolving structure and multifaceted nature of real-world systems.

**Key Features**  
- **Dynamic Heterogeneous Network Representation**: Model both the temporal evolution and the diversity of nodes/edges.  
- **Task-Specific Evaluation**: Incorporate built-in metrics to gauge how well your representations perform on real-world tasks.  
- **Extensible Architecture**: Adapt or extend modules for specialized use cases without breaking existing workflows.  
- **Easy Installation & Integration**: Install via `pip` and seamlessly integrate with popular Python libraries.  
- **Efficient Implementation**: Enjoy competitive execution times, even at large scales.

#### Getting Started
You can install **PyDHNet** using:
```r
pip install pydhnet
```

Ready to get started? [Install PyDHNet from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pydhnet/) or explore the source code and examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/hoangntc/PyDHNet).


# PyTFL
![PyTFL: A python-based neural team formation toolkit](/images/softwares/pytfl.png)

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pytfl.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pytfl/)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/pytfl.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pytfl/)
[![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pytfl.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pytfl/)

### PyTFL: A Python Toolkit for Team Formation

**PyTFL** is an open-source Python library designed to streamline the process of assembling expert teams based on required skills. It integrates cutting-edge techniques—including neural-based approaches—to support every phase of the team formation workflow, from preparing collaboration graphs and training models to systematically evaluating results and predicting optimal teams.

Key features include:
- **Collaboration Graph Preparation**: Easily build and manage graphs that map out expert relationships.
- **Model Training & Validation**: Incorporate neural-based and traditional methods to fine-tune and assess team formation models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Leverage both qualitative and quantitative metrics for a comprehensive understanding of model performance.
- **Efficient Team Formation**: Quickly generate expert teams, ensuring the right mix of skills and compatibility.

While there has been extensive research on the team formation problem, **PyTFL** stands out as the first publicly available toolkit offering a seamless, end-to-end solution. Whether you’re a researcher or practitioner, PyTFL empowers you to bridge the gap between cutting-edge theory and real-world team formation.

#### Getting Started
You can install **PyTFL** using:
```r
pip install pytfl
```

You can find the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/radinhamidi/Team_Formation_Library/) or install it directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pytfl/) to get started.
