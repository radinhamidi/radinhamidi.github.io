**Hello and welcome!**  

I’m an AI researcher specializing in graph representation learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. My work has spanned academia and industry, with a focus on designing intelligent systems that make sense of complex data. During my time at [Labs for Systems, Software, and Semantics](https://ls3.rnet.torontomu.ca/) at Toronto Metropolitan University, I collaborated with a diverse team to explore how machines can better interpret and communicate knowledge.

I hold a Ph.D. in this field from Toronto Metropolitan University and previously earned an M.Sc. in Computer Engineering and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology. Along the way, I discovered a passion for blending rigorous research with practical applications that can transform the way we interact with technology.

Feel free to explore my [latest projects](projects.md) to see the ideas I’ve been experimenting with. If you’d like to connect or chat about AI, [drop me a line](mailto:radin@torontomu.ca)—I’m always excited to discuss new possibilities!
